## gt
gt is an assertion library for writing unit tests in C. It provides a non-intrusive way of writing assertion to validate the behavior of the tested code. When an assertion fails, it displays a colorful report with useful information, such as the line number, the expressions that failed the assertion and the values held by the expressions.
